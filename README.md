# Create ts node app

A little helper to create node apps.
This script will configure:
1. eslint
2. prettier
3. tsconfig

Some sane defaults are pre-selected, like allowing loading json files, preventing eslint from messing up line endigs etc.
You may want to fine tune eslint config (like preferred quote type). You can do this easily by modifying `.eslintrc.js`.

Have fun programming :)

## usage

`npx @xorsula/create-tsnode-app <name-of-your-project>`
